        <p>Processor</p>
        <p>The processor is the brain of your laptop and one of the most important components for programming. A powerful processor will ensure that your laptop can handle heavy coding tasks without slowing down. The 11th-generation Intel Core i5 to i7 or the 12th Gen Intel CPU are excellent options for the programming. They offer great performance, speed, and efficiency [1][2][3].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="RAM">
        <p>RAM</p>
        <p>The more RAM your laptop has, the better it can handle multitasking and running multiple programs at once. As a programmer, you'll likely be running several applications simultaneously, so it's important to have at least 8GB to 16GB of RAM. For more demanding tasks, you may need 32GB or even 64GB of RAM [3].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Storage">
        <p>Storage</p>
        <p>Storage is another crucial factor to consider when buying a laptop for coding. You'll need enough space to store your programming tools, applications, and files. It's recommended to have at least 512GB of SSD storage. If you work with large files, consider getting a laptop with 1TB or 2TB of storage [3].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Display">
        <p>Display</p>
        <p>A high-quality display is essential for long coding sessions. Look for a laptop with a 13.3" to 15.6" Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS display. This will ensure that your text and code are clear and easy to read. Some laptops also come with anti-glare and blue light filters to reduce eye strain and fatigue during long hours of coding [1][3].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Graphics">
        <p>Graphics</p>
        <p>While a dedicated graphics card is not necessary for programming, it can be useful for running simulations, animations, and graphic design applications. The Intel Iris Xe Graphics or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050/3050 Ti are great options for programming needs [3].</p>

      <section id="Battery life">
        <p>Battery life</p>
        <p>A long-lasting battery is important for programmers who work on the go or in areas without access to power outlets. Look for a laptop with at least 8 hours of battery life. Some laptops even offer up to 14 hours of battery life [1][2].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Keyboard">
        <p>Keyboard</p>
        <p>As a programmer, you'll be typing for hours on end, so it's important to have a comfortable and responsive keyboard. Look for a laptop with a backlit keyboard and keys that</p>
